##### A python package by Shubham Thakur

Hello All !

This is the Second release of my python package.
Basically this is like a boilerplate for creating your own python package.

### Can it tell me my future ?
##### --> Can you ?

### Will it help me invest in the right cryptocurrency ?
##### --> No

### Okay Then, What it does ?
##### --> Basically, Nothing :P ,  You can clone this repo and simply edit it and publish it to either test PyPi or Live PyPi.

### Wait, It does Nothing at all ?
##### --> It can do a few things allright. See the examples below.

#### Note : Make sure you Install and Import this package first.
##### Install Command - `pip install earthworm-shubhamt619`
##### Import like this `import earthworm`
##### Example 1 : Saying Hello
###### To say hello to a person, all you have to do is set the name by using 
`earthworm.name = 'John Doe'`
After this, simply use the sayHello() like,
`earthworm.sayHello()`
Output is 
`Hello there Shubham !`
